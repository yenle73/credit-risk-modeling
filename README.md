# Credit Risk Modeling

This repository contains my implementation of Credit Risk Modeling in Python, showcasing end-to-end development of regulatory-compliant credit risk models using real-world data. It covers key techniques such as data pre-processing with Weight of Evidence (WoE), fine and coarse classing, logistic regression for Probability of Default (PD) modeling, and model evaluation using ROC, AUC, and Gini Coefficient. The project aligns with Basel II and Basel III standards, making it a valuable resource for understanding how data science is applied in the banking industry. 

This repository contains a full implementation of the concepts and techniques covered in the course, including:

## Data Pre-processing:
- Handling missing values
- Data transformation using **Weight of Evidence (WoE)**
- Variable classing (fine and coarse)

## Model Development:
- **Probability of Default (PD)** Modeling using Logistic Regression
- **Exposure at Default (EAD)** and **Loss Given Default (LGD)** Modeling
- Building a credit risk scorecard from scratch

## Model Evaluation:
- **Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve** & **Area Under the Curve (AUC)**
- **Gini Coefficient** & **Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) Test**
- Assessing population stability for ongoing model performance
